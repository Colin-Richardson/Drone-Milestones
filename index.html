    <h2>1907 - World's First <b class="drone">Quadcopter</b>:</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/history-of-drones/"><img src="http://www.eyeondrones.com/wp-content/uploads/oehmichen-no2-620x330.jpg" alt="First quadcopter"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="bleu">The world’s first quadcopter was created by inventor brothers Jacques and Louis Bréguet,
        working with controversial Nobel Prize winner Professor Charles Richet.
        While undoubtedly exciting, it had some big limitations: being
        unsteerable, requiring four men to steady it, and — in its first flight — lifting just two feet off the ground.
        But it did innovate the quadcopter form factor we have today.</p>

  <h2>1943 - First Use of <b class="drone">Drones</b> in War:</h2>

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_X"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Fritz_X_Guided_Bomb.jpg" alt="German bomber drone"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="bleu">Fritz X was the name for the German guided anti-ship glide bomb used during World War II.
        Fritz X was the world's first precision guided weapon deployed in combat and the first to sink a ship in combat.
        Fritz X was a nickname used both by Allied and Luftwaffe personnel.
        Alternative names include Ruhrstahl SD 1400 X, Kramer X-1, PC 1400X or FX 1400 (the latter, along with the unguided PC 1400 Fritz nickname, is the origin for the name "Fritz X").
        Along with the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) similar Azon weapon of the same period, it is one of the forerunners of modern anti-ship missiles and precision-guided weapons.</p>

  <h2>1960s - First Time Citizens Had Access to <b class="drone">RC Devices</b>:</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="content">
      <a href="https://ethw.org/Transistors_and_the_Computer_Revolution"><img src="http://yesterdaysradio.zohosites.com/files/30521835.gif" alt="Transistor radios"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="bleu">Breakthroughs in transistor technology meant that, for the first time, miniaturized radio-controlled components were available to customers at a reasonable cost.
        What followed was a popularity boom in RC planes in the U.S.
        Mostly coming in kit form, these RC planes offered everything from indoor-flyable models to much larger outdoor models.
        The cottage industry that sprang up was an early example of the kind of community and market which emerged for consumer drones half a century later.</p>

  <h2>2006 - First <b class="drone">Drone</b> Permits Allowing Consumers to Recreationally Fly <b class="drone">Drones</b>:</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="content">
      <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/"><img src="https://jrupprechtlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/dronepilotlicense.png" alt="Drone license"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="bleu">Recognizing the potential of non-military, non-consumer drone applications, the FAA issued the first commercial drone permits.
        These permits lifted some of the limitations placed on consumer drones flown for recreational purposes.
        In doing so, it opened up new possibilities for companies or professionals who wanted to use drones in assorted business ventures.
        At first, barely any commercial drone permits are requested.
        However, that number soon ramped up.</p>

  <h2>2010 - First "Ready-to-Fly" <b class="drone">Quadcopter</b> was Created for Recreational Use:</h2>
  <div class="section">
    <div class="content">
      <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010/02/10/macworld-2010-hands-on-with-the-parrot-ar-drone/"><img src="http://www.fotoaparatas.lt/images/eshop/867258-1-parrot-ar-drone-2-elite-edition-sand-00.png" alt="Parrot AR drone"></a>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p id="bleu">The French company Parrot released their Parrot AR Drone, the first ready-to-fly drone which can be controlled entirely via Wi-Fi, using a smartphone.
        The drone was almost immediately successful, both critically and commercially, receiving the 2010 CES Innovations award for Electronic Gaming Hardware, and selling upwards of half a million units.
        The company’s AR Drone 2.0 further improved on the formula with an easier piloting system, making it easier for newcomers to pick-up-and-play.</p>
